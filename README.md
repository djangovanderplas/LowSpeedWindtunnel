# LowSpeedWindtunnel
Welcome to the beautiful repository of our LowSpeedWindtunnel test. This repository will be mainly used for data-analysis and possibly simulations in the future.
Please try to keep this repository tidy as we are dealing with a very large quantity of data.

## Plotting tools
Tools for plotting the windtunnel data itself can be found under Data Analysis > Data Analysis Tools, you can run any of these tools and it will spit out an interactive graph!
Tools for plotting the simulation vs windtunnel data and the cp plots can found in the home directory. The simulation one can just be ran.
The cp plotter you can select which point to plot by changing the variable.
